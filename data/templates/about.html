    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NYC TLC - New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission</li>
      <li>HVFHVS or FHV high volume - stands for "high volume for hire vehicle service". According to the TLC, the only two bases included in this category are Uber and Lyft.</li>
      <li>FHV black car - TLC licensed bases that dispatch trips on a pre-arranged basis</li>
      <li>FHV luxury limousine - TLC licensed bases that dispatch trips on a pre-arranged basis, where the baseâ€™s vehicles have a seating capacity of twenty (20) or fewer passengers.</li>
      <li>FHV livery - Also known as "Community Cars"; TLC licensed bases that dispatch trips on a prearranged basis, and are required to offer passengers up-front flat fares.</li>
      <li>Taxi zone - TLC sorts taxi pickup and dropoff locations into "taxi zones". There are 263 taxi zones in NYC.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Data Pipeline</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/stephaniewang26/Taxis-and-Rideshare-Apps/blob/main/data/reformatDataMacro.py">Link to Reformat Data (Macro)</a>
    <p>All data is from NYC TLC. For the macro page, I used the Yellow Taxi, Green Taxi, and FHV Monthly Data aggregate dataset. I removed the rows for green taxi, FHV lux limo, FHV livery, and FHV black car because their numbers were negligible and I wanted to focus on modes of transportation that the general population of NYC uses.
       I removed the "unique drivers" column because I thought that was redundant with the "unique vehicles" column. I also removed the "avg days drivers on road", "avg days vehicles on road", and "avg days per day per driver" columns because they were redundant and harder for readers to immediately process and understand.
       Finally, I removed the "percent of trips paid with credit card" and "shared trips per day" columns because they weren't relevant to what I wanted to analyze, which was more about the volume of trips.
    </p>
    <p>For the micro page, I used yearly taxi trip data. Because these datasets included every single taxi ride taken that year, there were hundreds of millions of lines per dataset. Instead of combing through that data, I used the NYC Open Data API endpoint to randomly extract 1000 rows from each dataset into the json format.
      Since the data was already in a convenient format, I didn't reformat it again.
    </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project will be looking into the evolution of taxi rides in NYC from 2016-2022.
      In my macro page, I will plot the monthly average number of trips per day for yellow taxis against high volume FHV (for hire vehicle) services. 
      My datasets also contain monthly data for the number of unique vehicles for yellow taxis and FHV services, as well as the number of vehicles per day and number of hours on the road per vehicle per day.

    <p>
      A piece of feedback I received was to make the title of the chart more clear, which I agree with. I'm going to color the lines differently so the taxi line is clearly emphasized.
      I hope to make the chart simple to understand by having only two lines to look at and clear labels for those lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my micro page, I will have a map of NYC that is shaded depending on the volume of taxi rides in certain areas. My dataset uses "taxi zones" to indicate locations, so the map can be divided up by taxi zone or by general borough.

    <p>I didn't know I had to include a map SVG, so this is what my micro looked like before.</p>

    <p>One of the pieces of feedback I got was that it was confusing because my years didn't line up for the macro and micro pages. Thus, I'm changing both datasets to represent the same time period of 2016-2020.
      I like having the updated location dataset for the micro page, as it gives me more room to play with the specificity with which I'm representing the data.
