      <h1 class="about-header">About</h1>
      <p class="about-paragraph">Beep beep! Have you ever wondered about how taxi trips have changed since the popularization of rideshare apps like Lyft and Uber? This project looks into the evolution of taxi rides in NYC from 2016-2022. 
        <br>
        <br>
        First, I plot the monthly average number of trips per day for yellow taxis against HVFHV services. To take a deeper dive into the data, I present maps depicting which taxi zones these rides actually took place in throughout the years.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>NYC TLC - New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission</li>
      <li>HVFHVS or FHV high volume - stands for "high volume for hire vehicle service". According to the TLC, the only two bases included in this category are Uber and Lyft.</li>
      <li>FHV black car - TLC licensed bases that dispatch trips on a pre-arranged basis</li>
      <li>FHV luxury limousine - TLC licensed bases that dispatch trips on a pre-arranged basis, where the baseâ€™s vehicles have a seating capacity of twenty (20) or fewer passengers.</li>
      <li>FHV livery - Also known as "Community Cars"; TLC licensed bases that dispatch trips on a prearranged basis, and are required to offer passengers up-front flat fares.</li>
      <li>Taxi zone - TLC sorts taxi pickup and dropoff locations into "taxi zones". There are 263 taxi zones in NYC.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Data Pipeline</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/stephaniewang26/Taxis-and-Rideshare-Apps/blob/main/data/reformatDataMacro.py">Link to Line Graph Reformat Data File</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      All data is from NYC TLC. For the taxi and HVFHVS line graph, I used the Yellow Taxi, Green Taxi, and FHV Monthly Data aggregate dataset.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I removed the rows for green taxi, FHV lux limo, FHV livery, and FHV black car because their numbers were negligible and I wanted to focus on modes of transportation that the general population of NYC uses.</li>
      <li>I removed the "unique drivers" column because I thought that was redundant with the "unique vehicles" column.</li>
      <li>I also removed the "avg days drivers on road", "avg days vehicles on road", and "avg days per day per driver" columns because they were redundant and harder for readers to immediately process and understand.</li>
      <li>I removed the "percent of trips paid with credit card" and "shared trips per day" columns because they weren't relevant to what I wanted to analyze, which was more about the volume of trips.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>For the maps, I used yearly yellow taxi trip data. Because these datasets included every single taxi ride taken that year, there were hundreds of millions of lines per dataset.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Instead of combing through that data, I used the NYC Open Data API endpoint to randomly extract 100,000 rows from each year's dataset into the json format.</li>
      <li>Then, I used Python to combine the data into a large dictionary, with the keys being each year. This made the data easier to template.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>FEEDBACK AND TAKEAWAYS</h3>

    <img class="feedback-img" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/695300782102282332/1230704659786764339/IMG_2045.jpg?ex=66344a08&is=6621d508&hm=976e6d97fe686f0de173a0bdd9b396ab68c3099e3a61fa26e566dd9dd112755b&" width = "400">
      
    <p>
      A piece of feedback I received was to make the title of the chart more clear, which I agree with. I'm going to color the lines differently so the taxi line is clearly emphasized.
      I hope to make the chart simple to understand by having only two lines to look at and clear labels for those lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my micro page, I have a map of NYC that is shaded depending on the volume of taxi rides in certain areas. My dataset uses "taxi zones" to indicate locations, so the map can be divided up by taxi zone or by general borough.

    <p>I didn't know I had to include a map SVG, so this is what my micro looked like before.</p>

    <p>One of the pieces of feedback I got was that it was confusing because my years didn't line up for the macro and micro pages. Thus, I changed both datasets to represent the same time period of 2016-2022.
      I like having the updated location dataset for the micro page, as it gives me more room to play with the specificity with which I represent the data.
